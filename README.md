Academic project done with @delgigio. 

We developed a complete pipeline based on bayesian statistics and modellin using PyMC. The dataset was the Climate Change dataset from Berkeley Earth: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data . 

The work ranges from an exploration of the dataset to multiple frequentist/bayesian hypothesis tests, linear regression models and a comparison between pooleed, unpooled and hierarchical bayesian models performances on the dataset.
Each section contains detailed thinking process for the priors, prior and posterior predictive checks as well as visual aids.
